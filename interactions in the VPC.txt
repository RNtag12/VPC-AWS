The overall solution architecture is made of a VPC that is connected to the internet. The VPC serves as the foundation of the network from which AWS resources can be lunched. 
For the internet to reach the resources inside of the VPC, an Internet Gateway must be created. An IGW acts as a channel for communication between resources in the VPC and the internet. 
Note that the IGW is connected to the VPC via the VPCtoIGWConnection (VPCGatewayAttachment). 
In the VPC, there are public subnets and private subnets that will contain the resources that will be used for the project including EC2 instances. 
Public Private subnet 1 host to web application instances that manage user interactions and receives communication over the internet using port 80. 
These instances connect to the internet via an Internet Gateway (IGW), which allows both incoming and outgoing traffic. 
The Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes incoming traffic evenly among the web instances, ensuring that no one instance is overloaded and therefore improving scalability and flexibility. 
In Private subnets 1 and 2 there are also API Endpoint instances. Those instances allow programmatic access to the application over port 5000, which is only accessible by web instances via configured security groups. 
The private subnets connect to the internet via NAT Gateways which prevents direct internet access of the private subnets from the internet. 
The database instance (RDS) is on private subnet 3 and 4 and cannot be accessed directly from the internet. It is only accessible from the web application instance with read and write access enabled using IAM roles.
The RDS Database instance can also be accessible It enables high availability with multi-AZ deployment, ensuring uninterrupted operation during disruptions. 
Security groups maintain access controls, enabling only authorized instances to interface with the database and therefore assuring more security within the VPC.
